Below is a list of every audiobank in the vanilla ROMs of *Ocarina of Time* and *Majora's Mask*, every entry contains the following information:

* Audiobank index value
* Audiobank name (Same as the ROM Description name)
* Sequences that use the audiobank
* Number of instruments within the audiobank (indicated by `NUM_INST`)
* Number of drums within the audiobank (indicated by `NUM_DRUM`)
* Number of sound effects within the audiobank (indicated by `NUM_SFX`)
* Audiotable the audiobank uses (indicated by `ATnum`)
* Instrument list, drum list, and sound effect list (if there are no drums or sound effects there will be no list)
* MIDI program numbers you can use to access the instruments, drums, or sound effects
* MIDI note ranges for the different drum samples within the percussion kits

!!! info "Index Number to Note Number"
    For instruments the pointer index value is equivalent to the program number, however, for drums & sound effects the pointer index value is equivalent to the MIDI note number minus `21`.

!!! info "MIDI Notation"
    All notes (e.g. `C5 (60)`) are using MIDI notation, they are not using piano notation. Using piano notation, the equivalent to MIDI note `60` would be `C4` instead of `C5`.

=== "Ocarina of Time Audiobanks"

    !!! info "Instrument Names"
        Some instruments are named after the closest instrument known by the community, though some are named after the name of the sample that was used to create the instrument (e.g. Shine, Fantasia, Spaceosphere, Enigmatic).

    ??? audiobank "Audiobank 0x00 (SFX Bank)"

        Audiobank `0x00` is the first of the two main SFX audiobanks. It is mostly guesswork for what most of the sound effects are as mapping them out is done completely by listening to the samples themselves in N64 Soundlist Tool (for which many samples are pitched up or down in-game, so the pitches are "off" when being played back) and figuring out what sound is used where in the game.

        Sequences that use this audiobank are listed below:

        * `0x00: Master Sequence`
        * `0x44: Ocarina Song: "Saria's Song"`
        * `0x45: Ocarina Song: "Epona's Song"`
        * `0x46: Ocarina Song: "Zelda's Lullaby"`
        * `0x47: Ocarina Song: "Sun's Song"`
        * `0x48: Ocarina Song: "Song of Time"`
        * `0x49: Ocarina Song: "Song of Storms"`
        * `0x6D: Unknown Technical Sequence`

        The number of instruments, drum, and sound effects, as well as the audiotable the audiobank uses, are listed below:

        * `NUM_INST: 92`
        * `NUM_DRUM: 4`
        * `NUM_SFX: 136`
        * `ATnum: 0`

        ## Instruments (Program Number: 0x00 to 0x5B)
        Below is a list of the "instruments" inside of audiobank `0x00`. These work exactly as regular instruments do, you can even import them into a custom audiobank as an instrument and use it in a sequence just like any regular instrument; and this is a common structure for the sound effects within the game.

        You can access these instruments when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x00 (0)` to `0x5B (91)`
        !!! info "Program Numbers"  
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Some sound effects using the instrument structure have multiple samples, the sound effects using multiple samples indicate which region contains which sound effect sample (e.g. `0x00: Low: SFX name, Mid: SFX Name, High: SFX Name`). Any sound effects without multiple regions use the mid (primary) sample.

        ## Sound Effects (Program Number: 7E)
        Below is a list of the "sound effects" inside of audiobank `0x00`. These work nearly identical to how percussion sets work except for how they are structured, they cannot be imported into audiobanks because their structure is built directly into a pointer array within `<absfxlist>`.

        You can access these sound effects when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x7E (126)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Sound effects can only have one sample per sound effect, but some sound effect indexes point to the same sample in the audiobank. The indexes that use the same sample as another index are marked: `[Same sample as (index value)]`

        You can access these drums when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x7F (127)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

    ??? audiobank "Audiobank 0x01 (Actor Sounds)"

        Audiobank `0x01` is the second of the two main sound effect audiobanks. It is mostly guesswork for what most of the sound effects are as mapping them out is done completely by listening to the samples themselves in N64 Soundlist Tool (for which many samples are pitched up or down in-game, so the pitches are "off" when being played back) and figuring out what sound is used where in the game.

        Sequences that use this audiobank are listed below:
        
        * `0x00: Master Sequence`
        * `0x6D: Unknown Technical Sequence`

        The number of instruments, drum, and sound effects, as well as the audiotable the audiobank uses, are listed below:
        
        * `NUM_INST: 51`
        * `NUM_DRUM: 1`
        * `NUM_SFX: 41`
        * `ATnum: 0`

        ## Instruments (Program Number: 0x00 to 0x7D)
        Below is a list of the "instruments" inside of audiobank `0x01`. These work exactly as regular instruments do, you can even import them into a custom audiobank as an instrument and use it in a sequence just like any regular instrument; and this is a common structure for the sound effects within the game.

        You can access these instruments when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x00 (0)` to `0x7D (125)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.*

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Some sound effects using the instrument structure have multiple samples, the sound effects using multiple samples indicate which region contains which sound effect sample (e.g. `0x00: Low: SFX name, Mid: SFX Name, High: SFX Name`). Any sound effects without multiple regions use the mid (primary) sample.

        ## Sound Effects (Program Number: 7E)
        Below is a list of the "sound effects" inside of audiobank `0x01`. These work nearly identical to how percussion sets work except for how they are structured, they cannot be imported into audiobanks because their structure is built directly into a pointer array within `<absfxlist>`.

        You can access these sound effects when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x7E (126)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.*

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Sound effects can only have one sample per sound effect, but some sound effect indexes point to the same sample in the audiobank. The indexes that use the same sample as another index are marked: `[Same sample as (index value)]`

    ??? audiobank "Audiobank 0x02 (Ambient Sounds)"

        Audiobank `0x02` is used pretty much for basically every ambient sound effect in the game. It is mostly guesswork for what most of the sound effects are as mapping them out is done completely by listening to the samples themselves in N64 Soundlist Tool (for which many samples are pitched up or down in-game, so the pitches are "off" when being played back) and figuring out what sound is used where in the game.

        Sequences that use this audiobank are listed below:
        
        * `0x01: Nature Ambience`

        The number of instruments, drum, and sound effects, as well as the audiotable the audiobank uses, are listed below:

        ## Instruments (Program Name: 0x00 to 0x14)
        Below is a list of the "instruments" inside of audiobank `0x02`. These work exactly as regular instruments do, you can even import them into a custom audiobank as an instrument and use it in a sequence just like any regular instrument; and this is a common structure for the sound effects within the game.

        You can access these instruments when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x00 (0)` to `0x14 (20)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        Audiobank `0x00` is the first of the two main sound effect audiobanks. It is mostly guesswork for what most of the sound effects are as mapping them out is done completely by listening to the samples themselves in N64 Soundlist Tool (for which many samples are pitched up or down in-game, so the pitches are "off" when being played back) and figuring out what sound is used where in the game.

        Sequences that use this audiobank are listed below:

These work exactly as regular instruments do, you can even import them into a custom audiobank as an instrument and use it in a sequence just like any regular instrument; and this is a common structure for the sound effects within the game.

        You can access these instruments when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x00 (0)` to `0x79 (121)`

            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Some sound effects using the instrument structure have multiple samples, the sound effects using multiple samples indicate which region contains which sound effect sample (e.g. `0x00: Low: SFX name, Mid: SFX Name, High: SFX Name`). Any sound effects without multiple regions use the mid (primary) sample.

        ## Sound Effects (Program Number: 7E)
        Below is a list of the "sound effects" inside of audiobank `0x00`. These work nearly identical to how percussion sets work except for how they are structured, they cannot be imported into audiobanks because their structure is built directly into a pointer array within `<absfxlist>`.

        You can access these sound effects when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x7E (126)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Sound effects can only have one sample per sound effect, but some sound effect indexes point to the same sample in the audiobank. The indexes that use the same sample as another index are marked: `[Same sample as (index value)]`

        ## Drums (Program Number: 7F)
        Below is a list of the "drums" inside of audiobank `0x00`. Unlike instrument index pointers, percussion index pointers represent a MIDI note instead of a program number.

        You can access these drums when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x7F (127)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

    ??? audiobank "Audiobank 0x01 (Actor Sounds)"

        Audiobank `0x01` is the second of the two main sound effect audiobanks. It is mostly guesswork for what most of the sound effects are as mapping them out is done completely by listening to the samples themselves in N64 Soundlist Tool (for which many samples are pitched up or down in-game, so the pitches are "off" when being played back) and figuring out what sound is used where in the game.

        Sequences that use this audiobank are listed below:
        
        * `0x00: Master Sequence`

        The number of instruments, drum, and sound effects, as well as the audiotable the audiobank uses, are listed below:
        
        * `NUM_INST: 126`
        * `NUM_DRUM: 1`
        * `NUM_SFX: 88`
        * `ATnum: 0`

These work exactly as regular instruments do, you can even import them into a custom audiobank as an instrument and use it in a sequence just like any regular instrument; and this is a common structure for the sound effects within the game.

        You can access these instruments when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x00 (0)` to `0x7D (125)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Some sound effects using the instrument structure have multiple samples, the sound effects using multiple samples indicate which region contains which sound effect sample (e.g. `0x00: Low: SFX name, Mid: SFX Name, High: SFX Name`). Any sound effects without multiple regions use the mid (primary) sample.

        ## Sound Effects (Program Number: 7E)
        Below is a list of the "sound effects" inside of audiobank `0x01`. These work nearly identical to how percussion sets work except for how they are structured, they cannot be imported into audiobanks because their structure is built directly into a pointer array within `<absfxlist>`.

        You can access these sound effects when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x7E (126)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`  
        !!! info "Data Structure"
            Sound effects can only have one sample per sound effect, but some sound effect indexes point to the same sample in the audiobank. The indexes that use the same sample as another index are marked: `[Same sample as (index value)]`

        Audiobank `0x02` is used pretty much for basically every ambient sound effect in the game. It is mostly guesswork for what most of the sound effects are as mapping them out is done completely by listening to the samples themselves in N64 Soundlist Tool (for which many samples are pitched up or down in-game, so the pitches are "off" when being played back) and figuring out what sound is used where in the game.

    ??? audiobank "Audiobank 0x26 (Goron's Theme)"

        Audiobank `0x26` is a bit of a special audiobank, it uses a different audiotable than other audiobanks and the offsets reference data later in the audiotable causing the ADPCM data for their samples to be split; however, `SEQ64` will automatically update their sample location upon importing.

        Sequences that use this audiobank are listed below:
        
        * `0x26: Goron Race`
        * `0x30: Goron Village`
        * `0x3F: Fanfare: Goron Race Victory!`

        The number of instruments, drum, and sound effects, as well as the audiotable the audiobank uses, are listed below:
        
        * `NUM_INST: 5`
        * `NUM_DRUM: 0`
        * `NUM_SFX: 0`
        * `ATnum: 2`

        ## Instruments (Program Name: 0x00 to 0x04)
        Below is a list of the instruments inside of audiobank `0x26`.

        You can access these instruments when using this audiobank using MIDI program number(s): `0x00 (0)` to `0x04 (4)`  
        !!! info "Program Numbers"
            Some DAWs start with program number `0`, and others start with program number `1`; because of this you may need to offset your program number assignment by a value of `1`.

        The list is structured and named like so: `Pointer index in HEX: Name of SFX`

        **Instrument List:**
        ``` linenums="0"
        0x00. Bent Conga

    ??? audiobank "Audiobank 0x28 (Unused Bank)"

        Audiobank `0x28` only contains instruments with bad pointers and broken samples. This audiobank is not used anywhere in-game, it is most likely leftover data from the development cycle; however, since it is unused that means it can be used for *anything*. Do not import the instruments from this audiobank, they will only place garbage data.

        The number of instruments, drum, and sound effects, as well as the audiotable the audiobank uses, are listed below:
        
        * `NUM_INST: 5`

=== "Waveform Instruments"

    The waveform instruments are a collection of synth waves available at all times for all audiobanks. These instruments cannot be assigned using a MIDI program change message as their instrument change command assignment values go over the 7 bit data value limit of MIDI; their instrument change command assignment values go from 128 (0x80) to 135 (0x87), so they must be assigned inside a sequence. These instruments' instrument change command assignments can be overwritten as audiobank instruments have priority for the instrument change command.

    !!! warning "Instrument 0x88 and Above"
        Waveform instrument change command assignment values 0x88 and above are not true instruments with true sample data like waveforms 0x80 to 0x87, they instead take compiled assembly code and interpret that as if it were real sample data. The starting address uses the audio thread and adds a random offset between `0x0000` and `0xFFF0` and interprets it as sample data; this is volatile and may cause issues, so it is recommended to avoid using 0x88 and above when no audiobank instrument is assigned to those values.

    **List of Waveforms:**
    ``` linenums="0"
    0x80. Sawtooth Wave
    0x81. Triangle Wave
    0x82. Sine Wave
    0x83. Square Wave
    0x84. White Noise
    0x85. D_801D4790
    0x86. Pulse Wave (Duty Cycle: 12.5%)
    0x87. Pulse Wave (Duty Cycle: 25%)
